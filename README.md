# GLaDOS, an attempt to progress humanity in the name of SCIENCE!
Thank you for agreeing, voluntary or otherwise, to assist in testing for science.

This will probably take a while to "complete," as, at the time of this edit, I've learned python for about 5 days. Hopefully most of the commands I do write will be useful/witty. Will update as time goes on.

#TO DO
Add command `>cave`: returns random Cave Johnson quote

Add command `>lemons`: return specific Lemons speech by Cave Johnson

Add command `>subreddit`: returns a random SFW subreddit

Add command `>subredditNSFW`: returns a random NSFW subreddit


Add "reply" to any form of greeting (list must be created): returns `Oh, hi, how are you holding up? BECAUSE I'M. A. POTATO.`

Add recognition of the string `Zuko`: returns `HONOR??!?!?!`

Add recognition of the string `science`: returns `Yes. Science. I agree, you should donate your body and free will to me. For science.`
